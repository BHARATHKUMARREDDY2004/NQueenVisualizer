# NQueen Visualiser

## Project Overview
The NQueen Visualiser is a web application that demonstrates the solution to the N-Queen problem using the backtracking algorithm. The N-Queen problem is a classic computer science challenge that involves placing N queens on an N x N chessboard in such a way that no two queens can attack each other.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualization**: Step-by-step visualization of the backtracking algorithm solving the N-Queen problem.
- **Customizable Board Size**: Users can input the size of the board (N) to see solutions for different values of N.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual feedback as the algorithm explores different placements of queens.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling the visual elements.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the backtracking algorithm and controlling the visualization.

## How to Use
1. Open the web application by visiting the [NQueen Visualiser](https://spontaneous-moonbeam-2c0198.netlify.app).
2. Enter the size of the chessboard (N) you want to visualize.
3. Click the "Start Visualization" button to see the backtracking algorithm in action.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the application.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file where the backtracking algorithm and visualization logic are implemented.

## Backtracking Algorithm
The backtracking algorithm is a recursive approach that attempts to place a queen in each column of the board and then moves to the next column. If placing a queen leads to a conflict, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different position.
